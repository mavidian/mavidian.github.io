# Services by Mavidian Technologies

We specialize in developing integrations that leverage the power of [Data&nbsp;Conveyer]({{ "/dataconveyer/" | relative_url }}). Along with support and maintenance, we can educate your team, augment your team for the project duration, or deliver the entire solution for you.

We get involved in a variety of projects. Each area of expertise below is supported by years of experience creating custom solutions. Time and time again, our projects were completed on time and budget. Time and time again, there wasn't a lot going on after the project delivery... no calls to report problems... the solution just worked as intended.

We are confident in our abilities to deliver. So confident that in case of a fully defined, tightly scoped project we are willing to assume risk and offer a fixed estimate for a complete solution delivery.

Here is a representative sample of our areas of expertise.

  Each service is rendered by toggleable-block.html, which takes 3 parameters:
  block-id - must be unique (to disambiguate data-target values of side by side toggleable buttons)
  block-title - block header (toggles contents upon click)
  block-body - block contents
  Template:
<!-- __title__ -->
{% capture captured-details %}
__body__
{% endcapture %}
{% include toggleable-block.html block-id="__id__" block-title="__title__" block-body=captured-details %}

<!-- Integration and Interoperability -->
{% capture captured-details %}
Throughout the years, we have worked with variety of platforms and technologies. We have successfully integrated Facets with third party products using extensions, web services, data transformations and many other techniques. We continually explore new technologies and emerging platforms. We will be happy to collaborate with your in-house experts to address the dilemma "how to make these two systems work together".

<!-- End to End Development -->
{% capture captured-details %}
Obviously, we are intimately familiar with the software development lifecycle, all the way from planning through construction to maintenance. Weâ€™ve worked with both traditional as well as agile methodologies. We can take the entire challenge on our own or provide support to your team throughout the process.

<!-- Solution Architecture -->
{% capture captured-details %}
We definitely possess hands-on skills and are prepared for down to earth development tasks. But perhaps the best value we can offer is at the higher level of abstraction where we get engaged in envisioning of the solutions and defining their architectures.

{% include toggleable-block.html block-id="03" block-title="Solution Architecture" block-body=captured-details %}

<!-- Data and System Analysis -->
{% capture captured-details %}
Thorough and accurate analysis is critical to many undertakings... whether it's new Facets implementation, version upgrade, or perhaps introduction of a new software funcionality. Our intimate familiarity with Facets data models, experience with a broad spectrum of technologies and attention to detail can help you identify impact early and thus facilitate smooth transition into the project execution.

<!-- Code and Design Review -->
{% capture captured-details %}
The famous [1-10-100 rule](https://totalqualitymanagement.wordpress.com/2009/02/25/what-is-1-10-100-rule/){:target='_blank'} comes to mind. We can reduce your software costs by correcting defects early or preventing them altogether. If you are planning software deployment, let us review your code before promoting it into production. Or better yet, contact us early in the process, so that we can participate in the design phase and help in avoiding potential rework.
{% endcapture %}
{% include toggleable-block.html block-id="05" block-title="Code and Design Review" block-body=captured-details %}

<!-- Facets Extensibility_ -->
{% capture captured-details %}
When it comes to Facets extensions, there is very little we may not know about. Over the years, we have created numerous extensions of all kinds, not only XCOM and embedded, but also using legacy technologies, such as XSQL and even XWIN. We have done extensive research to explore inner-workings of Facets extensibility platform. We welcome inquiries on any topic related to Facets extensions.

<!-- Facets Services -->
{% capture captured-details %}
The library of Facets services is a complex platform to integrate Facets with the rest of your enterprise. Such broad range of services that involve SOAP/WSDL as well as REST technologies can be challenging to master. Our experience encompasses numerous projects that involved Facets services along with related aspects, such as security or application server setup and maintenance.

<!-- Facets Open Access -->
{% capture captured-details %}
Facets Open Access involves many Facets related technologies formerly known as FXI or Facets eXtended Intergration. Sometimes, a solution may involve two or more such technologies. For example, a Facets extension may consumes a Facets service to execute its business logic, or perhaps data sent to the Interactive Driver needs some elements populated by an extension. Often, alternative solutions exist and it is not obvious which one is best. Let us help you define the optimal approach to address your unique requirements.

{% include toggleable-block.html block-id="08" block-title="Facets Open Access" block-body=captured-details %}

<!-- Facets Customizations -->
{% capture captured-details %}
There are so many ways to customize Facets. For example, batch jobs can be augmented with new steps or actions, custom searches can be introduced, some screen elements can be updated. We've even taken this concept a step further: core Facets customization. This is a danger zone only to be entered under very special circumstances. Nevertheless, it is a possibility.
{% endcapture %}
{% include toggleable-block.html block-id="09" block-title="Facets Customizations" block-body=captured-details %}

<!-- Troubleshooting -->
{% capture captured-details %}
No system is perfect.  You may be experiencing occasional system crashes. Or you may be noticing data becoming corrupted from time to time. Or it may be related to performance, perhaps on some days your nightly batch window is too small. Let us work with your team on identifying the root cause. Our years of experience working with various Facets installations can make a difference.
{% endcapture %}
{% include toggleable-block.html block-id="10" block-title="Troubleshooting" block-body=captured-details %}

<!-- Education -->
{% capture captured-details %}
We offer training and mentoring of your in-house technical teams. We have standard offerings to help you leverage [Data&nbsp;Conveyer]({{ "/dataconveyer/" | relative_url }}) to its full potential. In addition, we can provide customized training in other areas of expertise, such as Facets data models or Facets Open Access technologies (formerly known as FXI).
{% endcapture %}
{% include toggleable-block.html block-id="11" block-title="Education" block-body=captured-details %}

<!-- More... -->
{% capture captured-details %}
There are so many other areas that we can provide value to your business.  We specialize in the proverbial "out of the box" thinking... from exploiting undocumented APIs to leveraging modern techniques and applying unique design patterns. Even if you heard "no, it can't be done" before, please give us a call or reach our via the social media links below. You may be pleasantly surprised by the answer.
